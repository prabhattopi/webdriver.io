Page Object Model is used when we need to write duplicate test for the diffrent file
  so instead just copy pastin we are using again again.
  just works like we did in react component

  1.Seperate tests and locators
  2.Reuse code
  3.Improves redability
  

// Hooks are of before and after (its written in describe block)
// beforeEach and AfterEach

$-->findElement
$$-->findElements(Array)

waitCommands-->Some website wait before fetching so we can wait so it not give thro error in production
help more stable test perform while waiting 
now maza aaa gya masai ka testing karne me

Creating helper function give help us to go with and restricted with duplication(//)

put baseUrl in the configfile so we can not always hardCoded the things

//escaping a test just write xdescribe()--->it will escape the test
